    Fixed bug in ORM Declarative where the ``__table__`` directive could not be
    declared as a class function with :func:`_orm.declared_attr` on a
    superclass, including an ``__abstract__`` class as well as coming from the
    declarative base itself.  This was a regression since 1.4 where this was
    working, and there were apparently no tests for this particular use case.
