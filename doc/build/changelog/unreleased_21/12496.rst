    Added new Core feature :func:`_sql.from_dml_column` that may be used in
    expressions inside of :meth:`.UpdateBase.values` for INSERT or UPDATE; this
    construct will copy whatever SQL expression is used for the given target
    column in the statement to be used with additional columns. The construct
    is mostly intended to be a helper with ORM :class:`.hybrid_property` within
    DML hooks.
